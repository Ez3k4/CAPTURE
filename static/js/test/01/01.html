            <h2 class="f1">Antibiotic Resistance</h2>
            <p class="f3">When comparing the leading causes of death with the number of annual deaths caused by antimicrobial resistance you will find numbers around 0.7 M in the literature. <br>
            And that's without counting the cases that are indirectly linked to AMR or were simply filed under a different cause of death. <br>
            But estimates predict that by the year 2050, this number will have risen to about the same magnitude as the number of annual deaths caused by cancer. <br>
            This means that antimicrobial resistance already is a significant issue and will become an even bigger concern in the near future!</p>

                    <p class="f3">But what exactly are AMPs? <br>
                        Antimicrobial peptides or AMPs are short cationic peptides with a length of around 50 amino acids. <br>
                        They're produced by the innate immune system of many organisms and combat bacteria through various mechanisms. <br>
                        Now let's take a look how the AMP could be safely delivered and produced inside antibiotic resistent bacteria like <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em></p>

                <p class="f3">For biosafety reasons, we've incorporated a constitutive Pseudomonas-specific promoter called pel into the plasmid.<br>
                This design guarantees that even if the plasmid is taken up by a lung epithelial cell, the AMPs wont be expressed.</p>

                These transport vesicles only target specified bacteria strains like <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>. </p>
